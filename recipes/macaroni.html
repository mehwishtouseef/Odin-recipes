        <li>4 tablespoon tomato ketchup</li>

    <h2>STEP 1:</h2>
    <p>To prepare this delicious dish, take a clean chopping board and chop all the vegetables after washing them. Keep aside the chopped vegetables for later usage. Now, add macaroni to a pot along with water. Add 1/2 tsp salt and give a mix. Now let the macaroni cook on a medium flame until soft.</p>
    <h2>STEP 2:</h2>
    <p>Next, take a wok and put it over medium flame. Heat butter in it. Once the butter melts, add onions, corn and bell peppers to it and saute the vegetables in order to tenderize them. Keep stirring them to keep them crunchy. Don't cover with a lid, otherwise the vegetables will limp.</p>
    <h2>STEP 3:</h2>
    <p>After sauteing the vegetables, add tomato ketchup to it. Stir well and then add chilli powder, white pepper powder and salt in the wok. Stir once again and cook the veggies for 5-7 minutes. Finally, add boiled macaroni to the wok and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
    <h2>STEP 4:</h2>
    <p>Transfer the prepared macaroni to a plate and garnish with grated cheese (optional). Serve hot. Pair up a beverage of your choice with this scrumptious macaroni recipe to make it a wholesome meal.</p>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While making macaroni at home, always cook it till al-dente, which means half-cook it.</li>
        <li>In order to stop it from over-cooking, turn off the pasta in just 10 minutes. Transfer in cold or chilled water, in order to prevent it from sticking together.
        </li>
        <li>To add more colour to your macaroni, use colourful veggies like zucchini, bell peppers, carrot and herbs in it. This will not only add colours but make it flavourful as well.
