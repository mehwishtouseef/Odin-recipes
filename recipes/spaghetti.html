    <h2>Ingredients for Easy Spaghetti Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Spaghetti:</b> Any pasta will work. I prefer to use whole wheat or whole grain noodles because they contain fibre and nutrients. If you use regular white pasta, please note the nutritional information will change.</li>
        <br>        
        <li><b>Tomato sauce:</b> To make good spaghetti, you need a can of cheap, preferably low sodium, tomato sauce that reads “tomato sauce”. Not “spaghetti sauce,” not “pizza sauce,” not “pasta sauce,” not “marinara sauce.” Just “tomato sauce”.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Parmesan cheese:</b> I highly recommend using a block of fresh Parmigiano Reggiano and grating your own. Pre-grated Parmesan cheese in a shaker contains cellulose as a filler and does not taste as fresh.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> You’ll need lots of minced garlic in this recipe which makes it just as flavorful as a homemade spaghetti sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Olive oil:</b> Use quality and extra virgin olive oil because you it adds to the flavor.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Dried oregano, salt, and pepper:</b> A simple seasoning to add to the sauce is all you need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Easy Spaghetti Recipe
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cook spaghetti:</b> Fill a large Dutch oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring to a boil. Add 2 teaspoons of salt and spaghetti. Separate pasta with tongs a few times during the first 2 minutes of cooking to ensure it does not stick. Keep cooking uncovered for 5 more minutes or until al dente, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Drain pasta:</b> Test the spaghetti for doneness towards the end by grabbing one strand onto a plate with tongs. Do not overcook until too soft. The key to tasty pasta is cooked pasta with a bite, al dente pasta. Drain in a colander.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Cook garlic:</b> Return the pot to medium heat and add olive oil, 4 garlic cloves, and oregano.Cook for 20 seconds, stirring constantly. Garlic cooks fast and can easily burn, so don’t walk away. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Add remaining ingredients:</b> Combine drained spaghetti, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, ground black pepper, and 1 more fresh garlic clove in same pot. Stir gently until warmed through. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve this spaghetti immediately!</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for Best Results</h2>
    <p>Here are my top tips for the best easy spaghetti recipe in the world!</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cook spaghetti in salted water:</b> Don’t worry, you will not be eating 2 teaspoons of salt. Salted water boils faster than unsalted water, it also adds a ton of flavor to the pasta and prevents spaghetti noodles from clumping together.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Cook pasta only to al dente:</b> If it’s edible with a bite but not undercooked and hard, it’s probably done. This is what al dente means. No one likes mushy pasta, plus it will break apart when you go twirl it on your fork.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Using gluten-free pasta:</b> Gluten free spaghetti made with brown rice or quinoa will work but it does cook faster than wheat. So cook for shorter amount of time and watch it to avoid a mushy mess.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Don’t reduce amount of garlic:</b> That one clove of fresh garlic at the end is a must!</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>To prevent garlic from burning:</b> Turn off heat before adding the garlic and it will cook with residual heat rather than burning.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
